## How to run

You will need to provide a `.env.local` containing your own **environment variables** to get this running. The environment variables are:  
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  

Then `git clone` this repo, `npm install` and `npm run dev` to get it running on localhost:3000.  
The Supabase keys can be retrieved from the relevant Supabase project dashboard.
